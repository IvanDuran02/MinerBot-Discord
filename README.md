# SlaveMiner

Personal project.

I use discord a lot and wanted to try out making a bot.

I used this to apply the what I learned from the discord.js documentations of how to use the API.

This app uses typescript which is then compiled down to javascript.

the main function of the bot was for the user to issue a command and recieve a random number of mined ores that could then be sold to a shop for a fixed price.

all user information is stored in a database using MongoDB.

this was one of my first bigger self projects where I learned a LOT about databases and async functions.
